We worked with the Utah Pride Center coordinator to assist them by finding an efficent way to distribute zoom links to 
community memebers looking to join group meetings. The coordinator was previously distributing zoom links by hand to each member, for each meeting.

Our web app is designed for the coordinator to create one zoom link for each person, which served as a personal access token for each users. 
This way, users can save their link through email or in a notes file, and access the link to the zoom meeting each time. The check in process is 
so that the user can check in for a specific meeting and access their profile information so that they can change their pronouns or preffered name for meetings. 

I designed the look of this app and the front end code in a way that operates both on a computer and on a phone. 
Most of the design elements were in coordination with the colors and functions of the Utah Pride Center Youth and Family Programs design.
